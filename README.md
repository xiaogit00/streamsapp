### Tired of using Google Sheets to track your investments?

Streams is a light weight browser based investment tracker that allows you to:  

:white_check_mark: Group a bundle of trades into **streams** for displaying an aggregate ROI - enabling you to better categorize and reason about different streams of trades.  
:white_check_mark: Get real time overall returns of an asset Stream (asset classes available: all US stocks, ETFs, International Stocks from 18 global exchanges, and :waning_gibbous_moon: Cryptocurrencies.)  
:white_check_mark: Quickly get a sense of percentage of **realized** and **unrealized** returns within a Stream.  
:white_check_mark: Blazing fast UI for updating and editing trades & streams.

Developed entirely with React, CSS, Express, and MongoDB for backend.
