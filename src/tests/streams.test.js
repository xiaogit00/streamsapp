// Pseudocode:

// import newStream, import dispatch; import streamReducer.
// Create the values
// Might need to find a way to check that a new stream is successfully created in DB - this requires us to make calls to the backend.
//  - Add a token
//  - import streamServices
//  - make a getAll call request - after adding streams, length of return object should be +1. Expect that.
//
// Initialize State of store
// Check that store contains new stream after making dispatch call. Again, expect that.
//
// Create the logic where the state of the database is not changed after the test (need to re-read up on how to do it for this, I rmb sth similar)
//
//
//
